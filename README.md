## About Me
- I’m a coder who thrives in the terminal and the browser alike. 
- C gives me control down to the metal, Python lets me prototype like a mad scientist, and JavaScript brings my ideas to life on the web. 
- If I were in Jujutsu Kaisen, I’d be summoning shikigami made of pointers, regex, and async functions.
