## About Me
- I’m a programmer who thrives in the terminal and the browser alike. 
- C gives me control down to the metal, Python lets me prototype like a mad scientist, and JavaScript brings my ideas to life on the web. 
- If I were in Jujutsu Kaisen, I’d be summoning shikigami made of pointers, regex, and async functions.

## Current Projects-flow
- creating a simple socket-web-server for my custom terminal chat room - [socketServer](https://github.com/fl0wstate/c-deep-dive/tree/main/sockets)
- building discord-like chat room but to be entirely runned on the terminal - [tchat](https://github.com/fl0wstate/c-deep-dive/tree/main/chat-app)
