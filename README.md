      <h3>Hey, I'm <strong>fl0wstate</strong> 👋</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy building things from scratch, experimenting with new ideas, and pushing my limits as a developer.  
        From low-level C programs to Python prototypes and full-on web projects in JavaScript, coding is where I enter the flowstate.

## 🚀 About Me
- 💻 Comfortable working both in the **terminal** and the **browser**.  
- ⚡ **C** for performance and control, **Python** for fast prototyping, and **JavaScript** for creating on the web.  
- 🎯 Obsessed with learning by building—whether that’s small utilities, experimental servers, or terminal-based apps.  
- 🎬 If coding were anime, my cursed technique would probably involve pointers, regex, and async functions.
