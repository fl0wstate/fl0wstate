      <h3>Hey, I'm <strong>fl0wstate</strong>.</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy building things from scratch, experimenting with new ideas, and pushing my limits as a developer.  
        From low-level C programs to Python prototypes and full-on web projects in JavaScript, coding is where I enter the flowstate.

##  About Me
-  Comfortable working both in the **terminal** and the **browser**.  
- ⚡ **C** for performance and control, **Python** for fast prototyping, and **JavaScript** for creating on the web.  
-  Obsessed with learning by building whether that’s small utilities, experimental servers, or terminal-based apps.  
-  If coding were anime, my cursed technique would probably involve pointers, regex, and async functions.

##  Current Projects
-  [**socketServer**](https://github.com/fl0wstate/c-deep-dive/tree/main/sockets) – a lightweight socket-based web server for my custom terminal chat room.  
-  [**tchat**](https://github.com/fl0wstate/c-deep-dive/tree/main/chat-app) – a Discord-like chat room, designed to run entirely in the terminal.
